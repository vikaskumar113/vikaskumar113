# 👋 Hi, I'm Vikas Rajput

I'm a professional **iOS Developer** with experience delivering scalable, feature-rich iOS applications across various industries. I’ve helped clients bring their ideas to life through robust mobile solutions built using **Swift**, **Objective-C**, **SwiftUI**, and advanced integrations like **Firebase**, **payment gateways**, **ARKit**, and **Socket.IO**.

I've contributed to several live, production-ready apps currently available on the **App Store**, covering domains like field services, barcode utilities, productivity, translation, music, and relationships.
